# Readme

The generated sql code is only there for tracking db changes. It is not meant to be run directly since we are using Xata for the database.

Database schemas also need to be created in Xata web interface because pushing the local drizzle schema to Xata is not supported.

For more information about the database setup, take a look at another [readme](../src/lib/db/readme.md) in the db folder.
